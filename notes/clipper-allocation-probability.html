        <h1>⛵️ Racing Across Oceans, With Friends</h1>
        <p>
          This year, I've been participating in training for the Clipper 2025-26 Round the World Yacht Race.
          Learning to sail and live aboard a seventy-foot racing yacht is a fun challenge and the situation
          quickly fosters team bonds and friendships.
          At some point during the two weeks of training I've done so far, the question arose:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          What is the probability I'll be in the same race team as someone in the training crew?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In this post, we'll calculate an answer to this and some follow-up questions.
          But first, it's important to state an assumption: race crews are randomly allocated from the pool of
          all participants.
          We know this is untrue; crews are chosen to be balanced in age, experience, and skills.
          For instance, two medics that train together will probably have a lower chance of racing together.
          While this assumption might change the exact probabilities, it won't affect our overall conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's one more caveat: I'm signed up to all of the eight legs of the race, but some crew swap in and out of the boat between legs.
          We won't consider this in the calculations, but it can be done with some adjustments.
          I'll point out when this becomes relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will do the calculations algebraically, but plug in numbers along the way to get a feel for
          things.
          We'll use:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>\(N=750\) as the total number of participants,</li>
          <li>\(B=11\) as the number racing crews,</li>
          <li>\(n=8\) as the number of people in a training crew (I had crews of 7 and 9 for my two weeks so
            far).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That means there are roughly \(\frac{N}{B} = 68\) people in each race team, although only those on
          the same legs will race together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, let's consider the probability of myself and another specific person to be in the same
          race team.
          This is given by the number of people in the team, excluding me, divided by the total number of
          people \(N\), excluding me:
          \[ P_1 = \frac{\frac{N}{B}-1}{N - 1} = \frac{\frac{750}{11} - 1}{750-1} = 9.0\% \]
          (It's pretty much \(\frac{1}{11}\) as \(N\) rises above 150. The value of \(N\)
          doesn't really impact the calculation much, so long as it's large.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the probability of <em>not</em> racing with that person is \(1-P_1 = 91\%\).
          As is often the case in these sorts of probability puzzles, it's easier to first compute the inverse
          of the target scenario then subtract it from 1.
          Under our assumption of random independent allocation, the probability that nobody from my training
          crew is also on my race team is given by:
          \[ P_0 = (1-P_1)^{n-1} = \left( 1 - \frac{\frac{750}{11} - 1}{750-1} \right)^{8-1} = 52\% \]
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the final probability of racing alongside someone from my training crew is:
          \[ P_{\geq 1} = 1 - P_0 = 48\% \]
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a surprisingly high chance given the large numbers of participants and crews.
          For leggers, the probability is lower since both \(N\) and \(n\) decrease, but it's still surprisingly good.
          If I meet thirty other people over all the training weeks, there's a 94% probability I'll recognise
          someone on my boat during one leg (my poor memory for names notwithstanding).
          In fact, I have to select only eight other people on my race leg(s) to have a 50% chance of being on the
          same boat as at least one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find this calculation interesting because it reminded me of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">the birthday problem</a>, although it
          turns out to be simpler in its construction.
          Relatedly, we could ask what the probability of <em>any</em> two people in a training group being on
          the same race team is: it's \( 1-(1-P_1)^{n \choose 2} = 93\% \).
          We'd need a sample of just five people for there to be a greater than 50% chance of at least two of them
          racing under the same team name.
